## Recursion
- Recursive Functions
    - Base Case: to stop recursion
    - Recursive step; to get closer and closer to the base case
- Similar to iterative loops. Tend to be **less** efficient because of the call stack. Both method have O(n) runtime

New Concepts:
- Call stack
- Execution Context (執行上下文) - values inside the recursive functions
- Powerset
    - All subset of values in a list (eg. [a, b] -> [a, b], [a], [b], [])

## Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
- swapping neighbor/adjacent elements. 1 iteration/comparison each time, move the larger element to the right.
- Optimization:
    1.


Merge Sort
- **Divide-and-conquer**
- **Time: O(n * log(n))**
- **Space: O(n)**
- Split list into left and right recursively. Like a tree branching out.


Quick Sort
- **Divide-and-conquer**

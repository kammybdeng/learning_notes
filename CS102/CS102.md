## Why
**Data Structures**: particular ways of storing and retrieving data to be used efficiently
**Algorithms**: instructions that computer follows to carry out tasks


## Nodes
**Node**:
- contains two things (data and links/pointer) to another node
- basis of linked-list, stacks, queue, trees, etc.
- is an orphan node if has no link

## Linked Lists:
**Linked Lists**:
- a **linear** data structure
- comprised of nodes
- elements are **not contiguous** in memory

#### Runner technique
Runner technique: can be used in problem like: "return the **nth** last element in a singly linked list"
1. create two pointers at different positions but they move at the same rate
2. second pointer delay **n** steps behind the first pointer
3. when first pointer reached tail node, return second pointer


## Doubly Linked Lists:
- a **linear** data structure
- comprised of nodes like single linked-list
- elements are **not contiguous** in memory
- bidirectional

## Abstract Data Types: Queue
**Queue**: an ordered set of data (First in, First out - FIFO)
1. Enqueue - add to end of queue
2. Dequeue - remove from front of queue
3. Peek

**"Queue overflow"**: attempt to enqueue when queue is full

## Abstract Data Types: Stack
**Stacks**: (Last in, First out - LIFO)
1. Push - push to top of stack
2. Pop - pop off top of stack
3. Peek

**"Stack overflow"**: attempt to enqueue when stack is full


## Hash Map
- a data structure commonly used for key, value pair relationships
- build on top of the array data structure with indexing system
- **Hash Functions**: converts/calculated the index of an array from a given key
- key must be unique (aka. 1 key can only and will always map to 1 value), but *different keys* can map to the same value (aka collision)
- **separate chaining**: implement with linked list allowing values with same index to append to end of list
    1. worse-case senerio: all keys with the same index value, then lookup performance is as good as on linked list, defeats the purpose of this hashing implementation because of its fast lookup speed
    2. resolution for (1): can save both key and value in the linked list
- **open addressing - linear probing**: find next available index if hash index is filled
    1. other open addressing methods:
        a. can skip by n spaces
        a. quadratic probing: skip 1, then 4, then 9 ...
    2. above methods purpose is to avoid clustering
- hashing is **not reversible** because output of hash function contains less information (similiar to an image shrunk into a lower resolution image)



## Recursion
- Recursive Functions
    - Base Case: to stop recursion
    - Recursive step; to get closer and closer to the base case
- Similar to iterative loops. Tend to be **less** efficient because of the call stack. Both method have O(n) runtime

New Concepts:
- Call stack
- Execution Context (執行上下文) - values inside the recursive functions
- Powerset
    - All subset of values in a list (eg. [a, b] -> [a, b], [a], [b], [])


## Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
- swapping neighbor/adjacent elements. 1 iteration/comparison each time, move the larger element to the right.
- Optimization:
    1.


Merge Sort
- **Divide-and-conquer**
- **Time: O(n * log(n))**
- **Space: O(n)**
- Split list into left and right recursively. Like a tree branching out.


Quick Sort
- **Divide-and-conquer**


## Trees
Definitions:
1. A graph that does not contain any **cycle**
2. **Cycle**: a path through edges that begins and ends on the same node

### Breath-first
- Level-by-level search
- Implement with **queue** (enqueue all nodes on the same level and dequeue these nodes before accessing the nodes in the next level)
- Good for identifying shortest path

### Depth-first
- Search exhaust until leaf node is reached before move onto sibling nodes
- Implement with **stack** (sibling nodes are added to stack, but children nodes continue to add on top of stack. All child, child, ...., child node need to be searched/ push off the stack before we move onto the siblings nodes on the samve level)
- Can have recursive version - b/c recursion uses an underlying call stack

## Functional Programming

### OOP
In OOP languages, we often create a template for an object. First, instantiate an object. Objects contain **fields** that can store data and **methods** that can manipulate data.

### Functional
In functional programming, create solution mainly using functions. Functions are "first-class citizens," meaning they can be used to store and manipulate data (with limitations). Functions can be **passed in as arguments to another functions** and also can be **returned by other functions**.
